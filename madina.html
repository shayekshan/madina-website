            <h3>Medina, the city of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), is a city where he settled down until his last breath. His
                companions supported the true religion of Islam. In this city, the stronghold of Islam, rewards for good
                deeds are multiplied.

                Medina is a city in the Hejaz region of the Arabian Peninsula and administrative headquarters of the
                Al-Medina Region of Saudi Arabia. The Prophet’s Mosque, al-Masjid an-Nabawi, is in the heart of this
                city, a
                mosque established and originally built by our Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</h3>
