            <h1>MADINA</h1>
            <h2>Al-Madinah - <span class="gray-color">The First Islamic Capital</span></h2>
            <p>The city has also simply been called Al-Madinah (i.e. 'The City') in some ahadith[14]. The names
                al-Madīnah an-Nabawiyyah (ٱلْمَدِيْنَة ٱلنَّبَوِيَّة) and Madīnat un-Nabī (both meaning "City of the
                Prophet" or "The Prophet's City") and al-Madīnat ul-Munawwarah ("The Enlightened City") are all
                derivatives of this word. This is also the most commonly accepted modern name of the city, used in
                official documents and road signage, along with Madinah. </p>

            <h1>Taybah and Tabah</h1>
            <h2 class="gray-color">Sometime after the battle, Prophet Muhammad renamed the city Taybah</h2>
            <p>This name is also used to refer to the city in the popular folk song, "Ya Taybah!" (O Taybah!). The two
                names are combined in another name the city is known by, Taybat at-Tabah (the Kindest of the
                Kind).Medina is home to several distinguished sites and landmarks, most of which are mosques and hold
                historic significance. These include the three aforementioned mosques, Masjid al-Fath (also known as
                Masjid al-Khandaq), the Seven Mosques, the Baqi' Cemetery where the graves of many famous Islamic
                figures are presumed to be located; directly to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, the Uhud
                mountain, site of the eponymous Battle of Uhud and the King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex where
                most modern Qur'anic Mus'hafs are printed.</p>

                <h2 class="gray-color">The palace was built at the end of the first century AH</h2>
                <p>The palace of Urwah bin al-Zubair was built with stones, some of which were coated with mud and
                    others
                    with plaster. The palace floors are made of compacted pebbles, topped with a layer of mud and
                    plaster.
                    Some floors also consist of brick tiles and trimmed sills of volcanic stone.

                    The palace contains three courtyards of varying sizes, two of which are overlooked by three rooms,
                    and
                    the third is overlooked by two rooms and a kitchen. The palace also includes two wells within its
                    facilities, the first is inside the palace, and the second is outside it and is known as the Water
                    Distribution Well, which was historically famous, as travelers to Makkah were supplied with water
                    from
                    it.

                <h1>Exploring Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque</h1>
                <h2 class="gray-color">Islamic cultural heritage</h2>
                <p>Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque was built in 706-712 AD, and it was renovated several times, the last of
                    which
                    was in 1990 AD, during the reign of King Fahd ibn Abd Al-Aziz Al-Saud.

                    The mosque is 31 meters in length, from east to west, and 22 meters in width, The rectangular
                    structure
                    is eight degrees from the ground and has seven domes, the largest of which is the mihrab (prayer
                    niche)
                    dome. It also has a minaret, located in the eastern part, corridor and yard.

                    It is noteworthy that the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed Eid prayer on the site, and so did
                    Ali
                    ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) after the Prophet's death.
