            <h1>MADINA</h1>
            <h2>Al-Madinah - <span class="gray-color">The First Islamic Capital</span></h2>
            <p>The city has also simply been called Al-Madinah (i.e. 'The City') in some ahadith[14]. The names
                al-Madīnah an-Nabawiyyah (ٱلْمَدِيْنَة ٱلنَّبَوِيَّة) and Madīnat un-Nabī (both meaning "City of the
                Prophet" or "The Prophet's City") and al-Madīnat ul-Munawwarah ("The Enlightened City") are all
                derivatives of this word. This is also the most commonly accepted modern name of the city, used in
                official documents and road signage, along with Madinah. </p>

            <h1>Taybah and Tabah</h1>
            <h2>Sometime after the battle, Prophet Muhammad renamed the city Taybah</h2>
            <p>This name is also used to refer to the city in the popular folk song, "Ya Taybah!" (O Taybah!). The two
                names are combined in another name the city is known by, Taybat at-Tabah (the Kindest of the
                Kind).Medina is home to several distinguished sites and landmarks, most of which are mosques and hold
                historic significance. These include the three aforementioned mosques, Masjid al-Fath (also known as
                Masjid al-Khandaq), the Seven Mosques, the Baqi' Cemetery where the graves of many famous Islamic
                figures are presumed to be located; directly to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, the Uhud
                mountain, site of the eponymous Battle of Uhud and the King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex where
                most modern Qur'anic Mus'hafs are printed.</p>
